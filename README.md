# retrieval based chatbot
This is chat bot which is based on term frequency and inverse document frequency and uses cosine similarity to calculate the same.  

TF-IDF, which stands for term frequency — inverse document frequency, is a scoring measure widely used in information retrieval (IR) or summarization. TF-IDF is intended to reflect how relevant a term is in a given document.

The intuition behind it is that if a word occurs multiple times in a document, we should boost its relevance as it should be more meaningful than other words that appear fewer times (TF). At the same time, if a word occurs many times in a document but also along many other documents, maybe it is because this word is just a frequent word; not because it was relevant or meaningful (IDF).

Defining what a “relevant word” means

We can come up with a more or less subjective definition driven by our intuition: a word’s relevance is proportional to the amount of information that it gives about its context (a sentence, a document or a full dataset). That is, the most relevant words are those that would help us, as humans, to better understand a whole document without reading it all.

As pointed out, relevant words are not necessarily the most frequent words since stopwords like “the”, “of” or “a” tend to occur very often in many documents.

There is another caveat: if we want to summarize a document compared to a whole dataset about an specific topic (let’s say, movie reviews), there will be words (other than stopwords, like character or plot), that could occur many times in the document as well as in many other documents. These words are not useful to summarize a document because they convey little discriminating power; they say very little about what the document contains compared to the other documents.
